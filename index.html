<!--l. 85--><p class="noindent" >Since its emergence in 1968, influenza A (H3N2) has evolved extensively in genotype and
antigenic phenotype. However, despite strong pressure to evolve away from human immunity and
to diversify in antigenic phenotype, H3N2 influenza shows paradoxically limited genetic and
antigenic diversity present at any one time. Here, we propose a simple model of influenza that
displays rapid evolution but low standing diversity and simultaneously accounts for the
epidemiological, genetic, antigenic and geographical patterns displayed by the virus. In
this model, antigenic phenotype is represented by a <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">N</span>-dimensional vector and virus
mutations perturb phenotype within this continuous Euclidean space. We implement
this model in a large-scale individual-based simulation and demonstrate a remarkable
correspondence between model behavior and observed influenza dynamics. We find that
evolution away from existing human immunity results in rapid population turnover in the
influenza virus and that this population turnover occurs primarily along a single antigenic
axis. Thus, selective dynamics induce a canalized evolutionary trajectory, in which the
evolutionary fate of the influenza population is surprisingly repeatable and hence, in theory,
predictable.

<h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-2000"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 93--><p class="noindent" >Epidemic influenza is responsible for between 250,000 and 500,000 global deaths annually, with
influenza A (and in particular, A/H3N2) having caused the bulk of human mortality and
morbidity <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#Xflufactsheet">1</a>]</span>. Influenza A (H3N2) has continually circulated within the human population since
its introduction in 1968, exhibiting recurrent seasonal epidemics in temperate regions and less
periodic transmission in the tropics. During this time, H3N2 influenza has continually evolved
both genetically and antigenically. Most antigenic drift is thought to be driven by
changes to epitopes in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XNelson07NatRevGenet">2</a>]</span>. Phylogenetic analysis of the
genetic relationships among HA sequences has revealed a distinctive genealogical tree
showing a single predominant trunk lineage and side branches that persist for only 1&#8211;5
years before going extinct <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFitch97">3</a>]</span>. This tree shape is indicative of serial replacement of
strains over time; H3N2 influenza shows rapid evolution, but low standing genetic
diversity.
<!--l. 95--><p class="noindent" >This observation has remained puzzling from an epidemiological standpoint. Antigenic evolution
occurs rapidly and strong diversifying selection exists to escape from human immunity; why then
do we see serial replacement of strains rather than continual genetic and antigenic
diversification? Indeed, simple epidemiological models show explosive diversity of genotype and
phenotype over time <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFerguson03">4</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XTria05">5</a>]</span>. Previous work has sought model-based explanations of the
limited diversity of influenza, relying on short-lived strain-transcending immunity <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFerguson03">4</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XTria05">5</a>]</span>,
complex genotype-to-phenotype maps <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XKoelle06">6</a>]</span> or a limited repertoire of antigenic phenotypes
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XRecker07">7</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 97--><p class="noindent" >Experimental characterization of antigenic phenotype is possible through the hemagglutination
inhibition (HI) assay, which measures the cross-reactivity of HA from one virus strain to serum
raised against another strain <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHirst43">8</a>]</span>. The results of many HI assays can be combined to
yield a two-dimensional map, representing antigenic similarity and distance between
strains as an easily visualized and quantified measure <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XSmith04">9</a>]</span>. The path traced across this
map by influenza A (H3N2) from 1968 until present is largely linear, showing serial
replacement of one strain by another; there are no major bifurcations of antigenic phenotype
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XSmith04">9</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 99--><p class="noindent" >Herein, we seek to simultaneously model the genetic and antigenic evolution of the
influenza virus. We represent antigenic phenotypes as points in a <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">N</span>-dimensional Euclidean
space. Based on the finding that a two-dimensional map adequately explains observed
antigenic distance between strains <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XSmith04">9</a>]</span>, we begin with antigenic phenotypes as points
on a plane, but relax this assumption later on in the analysis. After exposure to a
virus, a host&#8217;s risk of infection is proportional to the Euclidean distance between the
infecting phenotype and the closest phenotype in the host&#8217;s immune history. Mutations
perturb antigenic phenotype, moving phenotype in a random radial direction and for a
randomly distributed distance. We implemented this geometrical model in a large-scale
individual-based simulation intended to directly model the antigenic map and genealogical tree of
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
the global influenza population. The simulation includes multiple host populations
with different seasonal forcing, hosts with complete immune histories of infection, and
viruses with antigenic phenotypes. As the simulation proceeds, infections are tracked
and a complete genealogy connecting virus samples is constructed. Results shown
here are for simulations of 40 years of virus evolution in a population of 90 million
hosts.
<!--l. 101--><p class="noindent" >
<h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-3000"></a>Results</h3>
<!--l. 105--><p class="noindent" >At the end of most simulations, there remain only a few closely related viral lineages, indicating
that genealogical diversity is restricted by evolution in the two-dimensional antigenic landscape.
However, in 20 out of the 100 replicate simulations, we observed a major bifurcation of antigenic
phenotype and a consequent increase in incidence and genealogical diversity. These simulations
were removed from the analysis. Similar to Koelle et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XKoelle11">10</a>]</span>, we assume that although the
historical evolution of H3N2 influenza followed the path of a single lineage, it could have included
a major bifurcation. Here, we focus on one representative simulation out of the 80 low-diversity
outcomes.
<!--l. 107--><p class="noindent" >The virus persists over the course of the 40-year simulation, infecting a significant fraction of the
host population through annual winter epidemics in temperate regions and through less periodic
epidemics in the tropics (<a href="#x1-3001r1">Figure 1<!--tex4ht:ref: evol -->A</a>). Across replicate simulations, we observe average yearly
attack rates of 6.8% in temperate regions and rates of 7.1% in the tropics, comparable with
estimated attack rates of influenza A (H3N2) of 3&#8211;8% per year <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XMonto93">11</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XKoelle09">12</a>]</span>. Over the course of the
simulation, the virus population evolves in antigenic phenotype exhibiting, at any point, a
handful of highly abundant phenotypes sampled repeatedly and a large number of phenotypes
appearing at low abundance (<a href="#x1-3001r1">Figure 1<!--tex4ht:ref: evol -->B</a>). By including measurement noise on antigenic locations,
we approximate an experimental antigenic map of H3N2 influenza (<a href="#x1-3001r1">Figure 1<!--tex4ht:ref: evol -->D</a>). The appearance
of clusters in the antigenic map comes from the regular spacing of high abundance
phenotypes combined with measurement noise. Over time, clusters of antigenically
similar strains are replaced by novel clusters of more advanced strains (<a href="#x1-16001r1">Figure S1<!--tex4ht:ref: phenotypes -->A</a>).
Across replicate simulations, clusters persist for an average of 5.0 years measured as
the time it takes for a new cluster to reach 10% frequency, peak and decline to 10%
frequency. The transition between clusters occurs quickly, taking an average of 1.8
years.

<!--l. 119--><p class="noindent" >Remarkably, although antigenic phenotype is free to mutate in any direction in the
two-dimensional space, selection pressures force the virus population to move in nearly a
straight line in antigenic space (<a href="#x1-3001r1">Figure 1<!--tex4ht:ref: evol -->B</a>). Across replicate simulations, 94% of the
variance of antigenic phenotype can be explained by a single dimension of variation. This
mirrors the empirical results showing a largely linear antigenic map for H3N2 influenza
isolates from 1968 to 2003 <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XSmith04">9</a>]</span>. Because of the primarily one-dimensional movement,
antigenic distance from the original phenotype increases nearly linearly with time
(<a href="#x1-16001r1">Figure S1<!--tex4ht:ref: phenotypes -->B</a>). Antigenic evolution occurs in a punctuated fashion; periods of relative
stasis are interspersed with more rapid antigenic change (<a href="#x1-16001r1">Figure S1<!--tex4ht:ref: phenotypes -->B</a>). Antigenic and
epidemiological dynamics show a fundamental linkage, so that large jumps of antigenic
phenotype result in increased rates of infection (<a href="#x1-3001r1">Figure 1<!--tex4ht:ref: evol --></a>, <a href="#x1-16002r2">Figure S2<!--tex4ht:ref: driftvsinc --></a>). In general, evolution
via many smaller mutations results in a smoother antigenic map and less variation
in yearly epidemics (<a href="#x1-16003r3">Figure S3<!--tex4ht:ref: incmaptree_smooth --></a>), while evolution via rare mutations of large effect
exhibits a more clustered antigenic map and wider variation in seasonal incidence
(<a href="#x1-16004r4">Figure S4<!--tex4ht:ref: incmaptree_rough --></a>).
<!--l. 121--><p class="noindent" >The genealogical tree connecting the evolving virus population appears characteristically sparse
with pronounced trunk and short-lived side branches (<a href="#x1-3001r1">Figure 1<!--tex4ht:ref: evol -->C</a>). This tree shape is reflected in
low levels of standing diversity; across replicates, an average of 5.68 years of evolution separate
two randomly sampled viruses in the population. This level of diversity matches what is observed
in phylogenies of influenza A (H3N2) <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XRambaut08">13</a>]</span>. A spindly genealogical tree is indicative of
population turnover, wherein novel antigenic phenotypes continually replace more primitive
&#8216;spent&#8217; phenotypes, purging their genealogical diversity. In general, natural selection
reduces effective population size and genealogical diversity <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBedfordBMC11">14</a>]</span>. Here, by comparing
mutations occurring on trunk branches vs.&#x00A0;mutations occurring on side branches, we
find evidence for pervasive positive selection for antigenic change (<a href="#x1-3002r1">Table 1<!--tex4ht:ref: mktable --></a>). Trunk
mutations tend to push antigenic phenotype forward along the line of primary antigenic
variation (<a href="#x1-16005r5">Figure S5<!--tex4ht:ref: mutspectrum --></a>). We find a roughly linear relationship between the antigenic
effect of a mutation and the likelihood that this mutation becomes incorporated into
the trunk (<a href="#x1-16006r6">Figure S6<!--tex4ht:ref: probtrunk --></a>). Additionally, we find that trunk mutations occur at strikingly
regular intervals, with less variation of waiting times than expected under a simple
random process (<a href="#x1-16007r7">Figure S7<!--tex4ht:ref: waittimes --></a>). There is a relative scarcity of mutation events occurring in
intervals under 1 year and a relative excess of a mutation events occurring in 2&#8211;3 year
intervals (<a href="#x1-16007r7">Figure S7<!--tex4ht:ref: waittimes --></a>). This pattern arises from clonal interference between competing
mutations which reduces variability in the fixation process of adaptive substitutions

calculated rates of migration based on observed event counts across replicate simulations,
separating region-specific rates on side branches from region-specific rates on trunk
branches. We find that migration patterns on side branches are close to symmetric, with
similar rates between all regions, while migration patterns on trunk branches are highly
asymmetric, with high rates of movement between temperate regions and from temperate
regions into the tropics (<a href="#x1-3003r2">Figure 2<!--tex4ht:ref: spatial -->B</a>). Extrapolating from these rates, we arrive at an
expected stationary distribution of trunk location of 76% tropics and 24% temperate
regions, in line with the observed residency patterns of the trunk. It may at first seem
counter-intuitive to see higher rates of movement from the temperate regions into the tropics
along trunk branches, but it makes sense when thought of in terms of conditional
probability. Only those lineages that remain in the tropics, migrate into the tropics or
those lineages which rapidly migrate between the north and south have a chance at
becoming the trunk lineage, while lineages that remain within the temperate regions are
doomed to extinction. Along similar lines, Adams and McHardy <span class="cite">[<a

approach to show the importance of non-seasonal transmission to the evolution of the
virus.

genealogical evolution exhibits broad explanatory power. We find a strong correspondence
between the antigenic and genealogical patterns generated by our model (<a href="#x1-3001r1">Figure 1<!--tex4ht:ref: evol --></a>) and
patterns of genetic and antigenic evolution exhibited by influenza A (H3N2) <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFitch97">3</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XSmith04">9</a>]</span>. Our
model suggests that punctuated antigenic evolution need only be explained by a lack of
mutational opportunity and predicts that more detailed classification of influenza strains
will support a relatively small number of predominant phenotypes (<a href="#x1-3001r1">Figure 1<!--tex4ht:ref: evol -->B</a>). We
suggest that a large proportion of intra-cluster variation in the observed antigenic map
is due to experimental noise, rather than each strain possessing a unique antigenic
location. Additionally, our model accurately predicts the contrasting dynamics of other
types/subtypes of influenza. We find that lowering mutation size/effect or lowering intrinsic <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">R</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">0</span></sub>
results in decreased incidence, slower antigenic movement and greater genealogical
diversity, all distinguishing characteristics of H1N1 influenza and influenza B (<a href="#x1-16008r8">Figure S8<!--tex4ht:ref: h1n1_mut --></a>,
<a href="#x1-16009r9">Figure S9<!--tex4ht:ref: h1n1_r0 --></a>).
<!--l. 158--><p class="noindent" >In many ways, the historical record of influenza evolution provides little data with which to assess
rates of bifurcation of genetic and antigenic phenotype. We have observed no bifurcations in
H1N1 influenza from 1918 to 1957 and again from 1977 to 2010, no bifurcations in H2N2
influenza from 1957 to 1968 and no bifurcations of H3N2 influenza from 1968 to 2010. We have
observed one bifurcation in influenza B from 1980 to 2010. Thus, ignoring differences
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
between influenza types and subtypes, we have very roughly observed a rate of one major
bifurcation in 155 years of evolution. In our model, in 20 out of 100 replicate simulations,
we observe a deep bifurcation in the viral genealogy, which translates to observing
one deep bifurcation in 200 years of evolution. Thus, we suggest that the 20 of 100
simulations where deep branching occurs are not necessarily evidence of poor model
fit.
<!--l. 160--><p class="noindent" >In our model, when antigenic phenotype remains static, there may be multiple consecutive
seasons without appreciable incidence (<a href="#x1-3001r1">Figure 1<!--tex4ht:ref: evol -->A</a>), a pattern apparently absent from H3N2
influenza <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFinkelman07">19</a>]</span>. Additionally, we observe antigenic trajectories that are more linear and
deterministic than the highly clustered trajectory observed by Smith et al.&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XSmith04">9</a>]</span>. We suggest that
any model exhibiting punctuated evolution broadly consistent with the punctuated change seen
in the experimental antigenic map will show similar patterns of incidence. We can &#8216;fix&#8217; the
incidence patterns, but at the cost of too smooth an antigenic map (<a href="#x1-16003r3">Figure S3<!--tex4ht:ref: incmaptree_smooth --></a>). Evolutionary
patterns of the neuraminidase (NA) protein may provide an explanation. Epitopes in the HA and
NA proteins are jointly responsible for determining antigenicity <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XNelson07NatRevGenet">2</a>]</span>, and it is now clear that
levels of adaptive evolution are similar between HA and NA <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBhatt11">20</a>]</span>. Thus, changes in
NA may be driving incidence patterns as well, resulting in an observed timeseries of
incidence partially divorced from the antigenic map of HA. Incorporating antigenic
evolution of NA could thus yield a rougher antigenic map for HA, more closely matching
experimental results, while simultaneously yielding smoother year-to-year incidence
patterns.
<!--l. 162--><p class="noindent" >It remains a central question as to the extent that short-lived strain-transcending immunity is
responsible for influenza&#8217;s limited diversity and spindly genealogical tree <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFerguson03">4</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XTria05">5</a>]</span>. Our findings
suggest a possible resolution. Although lacking short-lived immunity, our model shows a
detailed correspondence to both the antigenic map and genealogical tree of H3N2
influenza. If an antigenic map were to show a deep bifurcation, where two viral lineages
move in different antigenic directions, then we would expect the same bifurcation to be
evident in the genealogical tree. Short-lived strain-transcending immunity provides
a mechanism by which lineages may diverge in antigenic phenotype, but still show
epidemiological interference. This mechanism would explain a situation where bifurcations
emerge in the antigenic map, but competition results in the extinction of divergent
antigenic lineages. The empirical antigenic map <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XSmith04">9</a>]</span> suggests that this is not the case; one
cluster leads to another cluster in orderly succession and there is never competition
between antigenically distant clusters. This supports the hypothesis that antigenic
evolution is primarily limited by a lack of mutational availability. This is not to say that
short-lived strain-transcending immunity is not present; observed interference between
subtypes <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFerguson03">4</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XGoldstein11">21</a>]</span> and evolution at CTL epitopes <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XVoeten00">22</a>]</span> provides substantial evidence for its
existence. Instead, we suggest that short-lived strain-transcending immunity does not
automatically generate antigenic maps and genealogical trees consistent with empirical
evidence.

another lineage moves tangentially, eventually resulting in two non-interacting viral
lineages. Instead, we find that only movement in a single antigenic direction is favored.
The origins of this pattern can be seen in the interaction between virus evolution and
host immunity (<a href="#x1-6001r3">Figure 3<!--tex4ht:ref: immunity --></a>). As the virus population evolves forward it leaves a wake of
immunity in the host population, and evolution away from this immunity results in the
canalization of the antigenic phenotype; mutations that continue along the line of primary
antigenic variation will show a transmission advantage compared to more tangential
mutations.

<!--l. 175--><p class="noindent" >Following the work of Smith et al.&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XSmith04">9</a>]</span>, it remained an open question of why a two-dimensional
map should explain the antigenic variation of H3N2 influenza. Although the authors astutely
speculated that &#8220;there is a selective advantage for clusters that move away linearly from previous
clusters as they most effectively escape existing population-level immunity, and this is a plausible
explanation for the somewhat linear antigenic evolution in regions of the antigenic map.&#8221; This
hypothesis remained to be tested. Here, we show from a simple model of epidemiology and
evolution that a linear trajectory of antigenic evolution dynamically emerges due to basic
selective pressures. This result simultaneously explains the linear pattern of antigenic drift
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XSmith04">9</a>]</span> and the characteristically spindly genealogical tree <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFitch97">3</a>]</span> exhibited by influenza A
(H3N2).
<!--l. 177--><p class="noindent" >To consider to what extent these results were contingent on the dimensionality of the
underlying antigenic model, we further implemented our model in a 10-dimensional
antigenic space. Here, mutations occur as 10-spheres, but the distance moved by a
mutation is the same as in the previous two-dimensional formulation. We arrive at nearly
the same results with this model; principal components analysis shows that the first
and second dimensions of variation account for 87% and 7%, respectively, of the total
variance (<a href="#x1-16010r10">Figure S10<!--tex4ht:ref: 10dgrid --></a>). Thus, our model predicts that future work probing mutational
effects will support an underlying high-dimensional antigenic space, even though a
two-dimensional map is sufficient to explain observed antigenic relationships among
strains.

the first year of evolution, every replicate virus population undergoes a similar antigenic
transition (<a href="#x1-7001r4">Figure 4<!--tex4ht:ref: replicateevol --></a>), resulting in a repeatable peak in northern hemisphere incidence (<a href="#x1-7002r5">Figure 5<!--tex4ht:ref: replicateinc --></a>).
After three years, repeatability has mostly disappeared, with antigenic phenotype and
incidence appearing highly variable across replicates (<a href="#x1-7001r4">Figure 4<!--tex4ht:ref: replicateevol --></a>, <a href="#x1-7002r5">Figure 5<!--tex4ht:ref: replicateinc --></a>). The 1&#8211;2 year
timescale of repeatability can be explained by the presence of standing antigenic variation.
In the initial virus population, there are several novel antigenic variants present at
low frequency (<a href="#x1-6001r3">Figure 3<!--tex4ht:ref: immunity --></a>), one of which, without fail, comes to predominate the virus
population.

two-dimensional strain-space, but enforce a cross-immunity kernel that directly favors moving

one-dimensional direction of antigenic drift, which instead emerges dynamically from competition
among strains.

rather than genetic mutation rate, and can be thought of as arising from multiple genetic sources.
When a mutation occurs, the virus&#8217;s phenotype is moved in a completely random direction
<span

deviation of 0.4 units. This distribution is parameterized so that mutation usually
has little effect on antigenic phenotype, but occasionally has a large effect. This is
similar to the neutral networks implemented by Koelle et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XKoelle06">6</a>]</span>, wherein most amino
acid changes result in little decrease to cross-immunity between strains, but some
changes result in large jumps in cross-immunity. This mutation model implicitly assumes
independence between mutations; each mutation&#8217;s effect is independent of genetic

<!--l. 219--><p class="noindent" >Daily incidence and prevalence are recorded for each region. During the course of the simulation,
samples of current infections are taken from the evolving virus population at a rate proportional
to prevalence. Each viral infection is assigned a unique ID, and in addition, infections have their
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
phenotypes, locations and dates of infection recorded. In this model, viruses lack sequences and
so standard phylogenetic inference of the evolutionary relationships among strains is impossible.
Instead, the viral genealogy is directly recorded. This is made possible by tracking transmission
events connecting infections during the simulation; infections record the ID of their
&#8216;parent&#8217; infection. Proceeding from a sample of infections, their genealogical history can
be reconstructed by following consecutive links to parental infections. During this
procedure, lineages coalesce to the ancestral lineages shared by the sampled infections,
eventually arriving at the initial infection introduced at the beginning of the simulation.
Commonly, phylodynamic simulations generate sequences that are subsequently analyzed
with phylogenetic software to produce an estimated genealogy <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFerguson03">4</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XKoelle06">6</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XKoelle10">29</a>]</span>. This step of
phylogenetic inference is imperfect and computationally intensive, and by side-stepping
phylogenetic reconstruction we arrive at genealogies quickly and accurately. Other authors
have implemented similar tracking of infection trees <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XVolz09">30</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XOdea11">31</a>]</span>. This genealogy-centric
approach makes many otherwise difficult calculations transparent, such as calculating
lineage-specific region-specific migration rates (<a href="#x1-3003r2">Figure 2<!--tex4ht:ref: spatial --></a>) and lineage-specific mutation effects
(<a href="#x1-16005r5">Figure S5<!--tex4ht:ref: mutspectrum --></a>).

from experimental noise. Indeed, Smith et al. <span class="cite">[<a

measurements predicted from the map differ by an average of 0.83 antigenic units with a
standard deviation of 0.67 antigenic units. We take this as a proxy for experimental noise and
add jitter to each sampled antigenic phenotype by moving it in a random direction
for an exponentially distributed distance with mean of 0.53 antigenic units. If two
samples with the same underlying antigenic phenotype are jittered in this fashion, the
distance between them averages 0.83 antigenic units with a standard deviation of 0.64

clustering with a variety of linkage criterion. We found that clustering by Ward&#8217;s criterion
